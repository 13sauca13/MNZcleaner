Cleaner for the VBS_MINER

This is a simple batch file to get rid of the virus named VBS_MINER that attacked my job´s net some time ago.

As the antivirus couldn´t detect it nor stop it, I created this script to remove it from the devices of my mates as well as cleaning their computers.

If you want the files of the virus you can contact me and I will send them (only for research purposes)
